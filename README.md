# The SQL-journey

A basic Flight Booking Management system

## Problem definition:
  Design a basic Database Management System for an Aviation company to manage its ticket booking


# Data Modelling
## 1.Conceptual Model
  This is where one builds a conceptual model of the underlying business. 
  It repesents the entities and their relationships of the business. It helps to visualize and understand the concepts and flow of the business.
  It can be done using two ways
  ### 1) Entity Relationship diagrams
  ### 2) UML (Unified Modelling Language)
  Here I used ER diagrams to visually represent the Fligh Booking System.

## 2.Physical Model

The conceptual model doesn't give us a structure on how to store the data or the datatypes of the data. It represents only the entities and the relationships. It only helps us to understand the problem and to communicate to the business experts.

The physical model represents a structure to store the data. The entities in here will become an actual table in the database.

Physical Model of Flight-Booking system:

Now this physical model can be forward engineered to create the database.
